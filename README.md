# Earth and Moon Animation Project üåçüåë

This project uses CSS and HTML to create a simple animation of the Earth and the Moon, simulating the Moon‚Äôs orbit around the Earth. The project demonstrates CSS animations and transformations, showcasing visually appealing orbital motion that resembles the natural movement of celestial bodies.

## Features

- **Realistic Orbital Design**: The project includes a circular Earth with a rotating Moon that orbits smoothly around it.
- **Smooth Animations**: The Moon‚Äôs orbit is animated using CSS `@keyframes` and `transform-origin` properties to create continuous motion around the Earth.
- **Simple and Attractive UI**: Designed with a minimalist style, the Earth and Moon have contrasting colors that stand out on a dark background, creating a clean and appealing animation.
- **Dynamic Rotation**: The Moon circles the Earth continuously in a loop, creating a realistic simulation of orbital movement:
